Generative AI — Meta LLaMA 3 with Hugging Face

This project demonstrates how to develop and experiment with Meta’s LLaMA 3 large language model using Hugging Face. It focuses on fine‑tuning, prompting, and deploying open‑source LLMs locally or in the cloud.

LLaMA 3 is part of Meta’s next‑generation AI lineup, available via Hugging Face and Kaggle. It supports 8B and 70B pretrained versions and integrates with frameworks like LangChain and LlamaIndex for advanced retrieval‑augmented generation (RAG) workflows.

Key Concepts:
- Fine‑tuning with LoRA / QLoRA for custom domain tasks
- Quantization for efficient model performance
- Prompting (Zero‑shot / Few‑shot) for flexible generation
- Validation across text and image datasets

The model `"meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B"` can be loaded via Hugging Face using your HF token. You can run and fine‑tune it in Google Colab or locally with **Ollama**, which enables CPU‑based execution.

With this setup, you can build your own generative AI assistant—similar to GPT or Gemini AI—using a free open‑source model from Meta.
